\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection}
Our research employed multiple data collection strategies, ensuring comprehensive and reliable information gathering.

\subsection{Experimental Design}
Scientific investigations often require precise mathematical representations. Consider the fundamental equation:

\begin{equation}
E = mc^2 \label{eq:einstein}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:einstein} encapsulates the relationship between energy and mass, demonstrating the power of concise mathematical expression.
